REDUX in React JS:-


Introduction

Redux is a state management library used in React applications.
It helps manage global application state in a predictable way, especially when data needs to be shared between multiple components.

Why Redux?

In large React applications:

Passing data via props becomes complex (prop drilling)

Managing shared state is difficult

Redux solves this by providing:

A central store

A single source of truth

Easy debugging and predictable state updates.



Redux Example:-



import { createStore } from "redux";

const initialState = {
  count: 0
};

function counterReducer(state = initialState, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "INCREMENT":
      return { count: state.count + 1 };

    case "DECREMENT":
      return { count: state.count - 1 };

    default:
      return state;
  }
}

const store = createStore(counterReducer);
export default store;
